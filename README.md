# URL-based Attack Detection System

This project aims to develop a system capable of detecting and mitigating URL-based attacks. While this README is a work in progress, it provides a basic overview of the project and how to get started.

## Key Features & Benefits

*   **Real-time URL Analysis:**  (Future implementation) The system will analyze URLs in real-time to identify potential threats.
*   **Attack Detection:** Identifies common URL-based attacks such as phishing, malware distribution, and cross-site scripting (XSS).
*   **Dashboard Monitoring:** Provides a user-friendly dashboard to monitor system activity and detected threats.
*   **Customizable Rules:** (Future implementation) Allows users to define custom rules for URL analysis.
*   **Reporting & Logging:**  (Future implementation) Generates reports and logs of detected attacks for further analysis.

## Prerequisites & Dependencies

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Node.js:**  (Latest LTS version recommended)  Download from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
*   **npm:**  (Usually included with Node.js)
*   **React Developer Tools:** (Optional) Browser extension for debugging React applications.

The project relies on the following dependencies:

*   **React:**  A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   **React Router DOM:** For handling navigation within the React application.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework.
*   **Axios:**  A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
*   **framer-motion:** For creating animations and transitions.
*   **react-hot-toast:** For displaying notifications.
*   **react-icons:** For using icons in the React application.
*   **recharts:** For creating charts and graphs.

## Installation & Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/FZRAJPUT/URL-based_Attack_Detection_System.git
    cd URL-based_Attack_Detection_System
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the client directory:**

    ```bash
    cd client
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will start the React development server. You can access the application in your browser, usually at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Usage Examples & API Documentation (if applicable)

Currently, API documentation is not available. This will be added in future releases.  The front end is built using React and allows login/dashboard access.

## Configuration Options

The client-side application can be configured through environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the `client` directory (if one doesn't exist) to define these variables.  Example:

```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
```
